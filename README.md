During the trasition from TF 1.X to Tf 2.X, TPU becomes more difficult to use.

Colab TPU only works at specific condition.

And it only powerful at eager mode.

If TPU is used at Graph mode, it is slower than GPU normally.

And the usage of TPU is too difficult to generalize.

Only try the TPU programming if you have sufficient time to study.

I left the basic code for the more study in this repository.

When I could generalize the TPU coding, I will update.
